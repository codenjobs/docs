# CODE Token


To facilitate the job posting with cryptocurrency and to make the system more crypto user oriented, we decided to mint a token of our own, using Solana network to deploy it because of its protocol capabilities and lot of benefits

We use Solana because of its speed and low fee. It will be the best way to use our service blockchain techs.

Any wallet that can hold Solana SPL tokens can send, receive or hold our token as well.

The goal of introducing $CODE is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the Code&Jobs Ecosystem without any intermediaries such as centralized third party entity/institution/credit.
