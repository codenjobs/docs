# SPL Wallet


Before you start taking your first steps in Code&Jobs, you need to have an *SPL* wallet to be able to store funds in the Solana blockchain and to be able to interact with Code&Jobs.

[Phantom](https://phantom.app/) offers a wallet and a browser extension with a user-friendly and easy-to-use interface.
