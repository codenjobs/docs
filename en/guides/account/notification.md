# Notifications
 
A notification feature is built into the platform that allows users to find out when other users leave comments on their posts, or when they reply to comments. They can also find out when a new user follows them or if they have left a message in their inbox.
 
Notifications can be seen in the icons located at the top of the navigation bar.
