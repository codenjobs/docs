# Posting of job offers
 
 
*Before being able to publish a job offer, the user must have [created an account](https://www.codenjobs.com/register) and [logged in](https://www.codenjobs.com/signin).*
 
 
There are three ways to post a job offer:
 
* In the navigation bar, clicking on the user icon, clicking on the *Profile* button, in the secondary navigation bar click on *Jobs*, then locate in the right pane and click on the *Post a job* button.
